# BCALDevHelper

## Welcome to my "**B**usiness **C**entral **AL** **Dev**eloper **Helper**" PowerShell Module!

This module is under development and contains various PowerShell functions designed to assist with different AL Development related tasks. It is by no means a finished product.
This module was initially created for my own AL Development needs, but I believe it could be helpful for others in the community. 
I would love to hear your thoughts and see how it could be improved to benefit a wider audience.

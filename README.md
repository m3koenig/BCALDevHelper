# BCALDevHelper

This is a PowerShell Module developed for some helpfull PS Functions.
Most are not at the state "ready", some could throw errors.
Feel free to test it. I will add and update more (I hope :D) and also add some documentations to it.

I'm happy if you send me feedback for this module :)

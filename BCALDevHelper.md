# BCBCALDevHelperHelper

> Couldn't remember the greatest code in the World, no, no! this is a tribute! oh, to the greatest code in the world!

The Name of the module is a tribute to the great "BCContainerHelper" and should not be an sign of megalomania :)

This Module is from AL developer to AL developers and I hope that here are some functions in here, that could be usefull or even nice to have.
